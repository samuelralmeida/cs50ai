# Analysis

## Layer 2, Head 2

This attention head demonstrates a strong focus on the sequential relationships within the sentence. The brightest squares form a diagonal line, indicating the head is paying attention to the relationship between adjacent words, or words in close proximity within the sentence structure.

Example Sentences:
- My [MASK] called me to play soccer.


## Layer 6, Head 6

This attention head seems primarily focused on the relationship between the subject ("me") and the verb ("called") of the sentence. There's a strong connection shown between "me" and "called," suggesting the head understands the direct object relationship. There's also a weaker but noticeable connection between "my" and "[MASK]", implying a potential understanding of possessive pronouns and their relation to the subject, although it's not as clearly defined as the "me/called" relationship.

Example Sentences:
- My [MASK] called me to play soccer.
